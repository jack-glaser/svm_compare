# svm_compare.py
In nonlinear support vector machine classification, observations are recast to a higher-dimensional domain before their margin is calculated. To perform this recasting, one must select a kernel function to perform the high-dimensional inner products (this is the primary parameter selection). This package provides an easy comparison for the performance of different kernel functions in binary SVM classification, implementing the analysis using an iterated quadratic program solver (quadprog). The package tests out-of-sample performance by splitting input data into a training and a test dataset.
